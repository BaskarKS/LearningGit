# git never give special importance for directories
# git will only track / stage / worry about files , doesnt bother directories

Eg: If a new directory is created without any files, its not tracked or staged
by Git. which clearly shows that git doesnt bother about directories

# touch dir1/{a..d}.py 
# create a.py, b.py, c.py, d.py - 4 python files

# whenever we are adding files then implicitly directories are also addedby git
# git add . # will add all untracked and non-ignored files from working directory
